This is still a work-in-progress.

This library is a ruby implementation of the ```encrypt``` and ```decrypt``` functions required to communicate with CCAvenue Payment Gateway (the new version).

```crypto.rb``` is the file you are interested in. We have documented it as much as we can.

### To Do

   - Add a sample controller (for use in rails application)
   - Add sample Views
   - Add generators to make it easy for prople to use this library without having to look at the code
   - Package this whole thing as a rubygem
